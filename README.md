# STOCKS
STOCKS is a small project that uses an open-source API, Yahoo Finance, to manipulate live data from the stock market. 
The script is aimed towards creating an environment for investors, like myself, to easily manipulate data to simulate 
what it would be like to have money currently invested in the stock market. The script is purely text-based.

## VERSION
Version 1.X - GIT commits with this header pertain to the original text-based script.\
Version 2.X - GIT commits with this header pertain to the GUI version.

### Motivation 
I started this small project to work with an open-source API and learn how to program in a scripting language.

### Future
-  Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
-  Use web requests to populate current information about a stock
-  Link script to an open-source news outlet about stocks
-  Use an external database to store a user's portfolio
-  Learn more about Python --> Cleaning up the code --> Organize structure!
