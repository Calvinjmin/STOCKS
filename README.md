# STOCKS
STOCKS is a small project that uses an open-source API, Yahoo Finance, to manipulate live data from the stock market. 
The script is aimed towards creating an environment for investors, like myself, to easily manipulate data to simulate what it would be like to have money currently invested in the stock market. The script is purely text-based.

### Motivation 
I started this small project to work with an open-source API and learn how to program in a scripting language.
